#### vxlan2pcap
De-encapsulate VXLAN-encapsulated PCAP


#### Go
##### vxlan2pcap

- This program will allow you to quickly and easily de-encapsulate a PCAP with VXLAN encapsulation.  Simply download the executable (ensure it itself is executable), and run like so:

./vxlan2pcap srcPCAP dstPCAP

#### Python 
##### vxlan2pcap.py

- Only use this script if you have to -- while it leverages all the great functionality of Scapy and its layers, it can be much slower than the Go version of this utility.
